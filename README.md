## Linear Regression to Predict MPG 

1. Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
Spoiler_angle, vehicle_weight, and AWD provide non random amount of variance. The maximum random variance was provided by ground_clearence and vehicle_length.


2. Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? 
In the image below, we see that the p-value is less than zero (5.35e-11), therefore, the slope is not equal to zero.

3. Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively?
Because the R squared value is 71.49%, this indicates that using the linear model, is effectively correct 71% of the time.
