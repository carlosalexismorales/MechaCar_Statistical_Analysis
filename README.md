## Linear Regression to Predict MPG 

1. Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
Vehicle_weight,spoiler_angle and AWD provide non random amount of variance. The maximum random variance was provided by ground_clearence and vehicle_length

2. Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? 
Since p-value is less than zero (5.35e-11), the slope is not equal to zero

3. Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively?
The R squared value is 71.49% which implies that roughly 72% of the time the predictions will be correct using the linear model
